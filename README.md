# Derivative Grapher

This is a program that graphs a function from user input, and its derivative, as well as the tanget line corresponding to the derivative.

# Instructions
If you just want the game, please navigate to the folder named "dist" and download "CalculusFinalProject.jar". If you would like the game with the source code, download the entire folder.

When the program is launched, an input popup will appear. Type the equation here, using y as the dependent and x as the independent variable.  
    -> ex. y = 3*x + 5
	-> ex. x^2
Note that you must include the * sign for multiplication (ex. y = 3x would result in an error)

Then, you will be prompted to enter the domain of the function (starting and ending x values)

Finally, a graph will pop up as well as the derivative's graph. You can move your mouse left and right to view the tangent line at each x-coordinate as well as the x and y values of the original graph and the derivative graph.

The program is unable to graph some functions which result in infinite y-values, such as y = 1/x.

# Code 
The code for Tank Fighter was written in java, using 2DGraphics to display graphics.
